## Layers

**Boundary**: The perimeter or boundaries of the Jack and Laura Dangermond Preserve.

**Camera Trap Location**: Georeferenced locations of the Reconyx PC900 cameras that were deployed by WRA between 2012-2013. Cameras were positioned where large mammals were most likely to be spotted, including water sources, existing trails, and movement bottlenecks. Camera stations were set using existing structures such as tree trunks, branches, or fence posts. Some stations used bait with scent lures to attract carnivores and other curious animals. 

**Streams**: The streams found within the Preserve.

**Restoration Areas**: This data layer provides information on the type, acres, and name of the restoration areas on the preserve. Specifically, there are Cojo Marine Terminal restoration area, Percoâ€™s Beach area, road restorations, oak restorations, Jalachichi ponds area, and ice plant removal and restoration area. The ice plant removal area is the largest site with oak restorations being the second. 

**Sensitive Species Communities**: This shapefile is derived from the occurrence data of 17 sensitive species listed in the California Natural Diversity Database (CNDDB). The occurrence data is selected by applying a 0.25mi buffer around the Western Gate property boundary. It covers both federally and state listed plants and animals that present on the preserve. The attributes include species common name and scientific name, range areas and acres, location with details, number of occurrence and occurrence type, species listing status and rank, ecological information, potential threats, and general notes. This information can be used to determine key protection areas that need to limit invasive pig activities.

**Critical Habitat**: This shapefile includes critical habitat areas of Gaviota Tarplant, Lompoc yerba santa, and California red-legged frog. These critical habitats are specific geographic areas that contain physical or biological features that are essential to the conservation of the listed species above that may require special management considerations or protection. The shapefile contains common and scientific names of the species protected, the USFWS species status, and the amount of acres for each critical habitat.
